## Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is the “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. 
— Arthur Samuel , 1959

## About Challenge

I am passionate in Machine Learning (it goes without saying as I am doing my PhD in Machine Learning). One day I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s) by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell), in which he talked about #100daysofMLcode Challenge.  I know I am bit (maybe too late) for this challenge, but better late than never.  #100daysofMLcode challenge means, studying and/or coding machine learning for minimum 1 hour a day for next 100 days.

This repository contains 100-Days-Of-Machine-Learning-Code.
In addition to that, it’s a my place to store all my machine learning self learning resources and place to track my progress.

## Motivation

By doing this challenge, I would like to learn more about Machine Learning, which is important and helpful for my research. In addition to that, I would like to show a rich portfolio of code, projects, and summary of the machine learning topics and models plus all of the additional content (available on internet) which I’ll discover over the learning journey.
I think, most importantly — I’d like to contribute to the existing resources aimed at encouraging others toward engaging with machine learning. I agree with Siraj when he says, “ [machine learning is the most transformative and important technology of our time](https://youtu.be/cuQMBj1cWPo?t=7) ”. 

My aim throughout this process will be to learn as much as I can with  accessible materials (mostly free)  while always being sure to provide useful links that help someone wants to learn machine learning.
