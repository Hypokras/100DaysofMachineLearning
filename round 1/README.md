# 100 Days of Machine Learning Round 1

## Day 0 | April 11, 2020

D-Day is here and finally, I am accepting 100 days of machine learning code challenge.

On 11 Apr, 2020, I am accepting a challenge, which is “100-Days-Of-Machine-Learning-Code” and the intuition behind this to dedicate at least one hour of every day for next 100 days in studying and/or coding Machine Learning.

## Day 1 | April 12, 2020

By starting day 1, I am taking this challenge and dedicate myself to study machine learning one hour a day till next 100 days.

I have read many self taught Machine Learning articles on web. I think first step is to pick a programming language. In my opinion, Python is the best for this. Even from my first year of PhD I am using this so I am more comfortable with Python.

But those who are new to Machine Learning, I highly recommend Python.

### Why python

- Simple and Easy
- Great community
- Great library
- Increasing popularity

Today I started reading Python Crash Course book by Eric. I read chapter 1, 2 and 3 today. You can read article [here]() and notebook [here](). 
## Day 2 | April 13, 2020

Today I read chapter 4 and 6 of Python Crash Course book. You can read article [here]() and notebook [here]().


## Day 3 | April 14, 2020

Today I learnd about OOPs concepts in Python ([here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20003/OOPs%20Concepts.ipynb)).

## Day 4 | April 15, 2020

Its very productive day. Worked on NumPy library. You can find code [here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20004/NumPy.ipynb). 
Tomorrow, I will work on Pandas library. I am planning to working on NumPy and Pandas alternative days.

## Day 5 | April 16, 2020

I learned basics of Pandas library. You can find code [here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20005/Pandas.ipynb).

## Day 6 | April 17, 2020

Get my hands dirty in NumPy library. You can find code [here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20006/NumPy.ipynb).

## Day 7 | April 18, 2020

Learned more about Pandas library. Now its time to move on different topic. I will learn more on pandas (excercise) if need. You can find code [here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20006/NumPy.ipynb).

Happy Weekend.

## Day 8 | April 19, 2020
Learned advanced NumPy concepts : Liner Algebra. You can find code [here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20008/NumPy.ipynb).

## Day 9 | April 20, 2020
Learned about Data handling, storage and file formate using Pandas library. You can find code [here](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning/blob/master/Day%20009/Day9.ipynb).

## Day 10 to Day 12 | April 21, 2020 to April 23,2020
I did two Covid-19 visualization project. One is effect of COVID-19 on India and another one is COVID-19 on Globe.
 Learned about web scraping, data cleaning and some visualization techniques. You can find code from [COVID-19 India](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/Covid19India) and [Covid-19](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/COVID19).
