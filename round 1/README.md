# 100 Days of Machine Learning Round 1

## Day 0 | April 11, 2020

D-Day is here and finally, I am accepting 100 days of machine learning code challenge.

On 11 Apr, 2020, I am accepting a challenge, which is “100-Days-Of-Machine-Learning-Code” and the intuition behind this to dedicate at least one hour of every day for next 100 days in studying and/or coding Machine Learning.

I will share my progress via :

## Day 1 | April 12, 2020

By starting day 1, I am taking this challenge and dedicate myself to study machine learning one hour a day till next 100 days.

I have read many self taught Machine Learning articles on web. I think first step is to pick a programming language. In my opinion, Python is the best for this. Even from my first year of PhD I am using this so I am more comfortable with Python.

But those who are new to Machine Learning, I highly recommend Python.

### Why python

- Simple and Easy
- Great community
- Great library
- Increasing popularity
